Hi

First project in Rust in months, be kind when looking at the code (if anyone does even)

To-Do:
  - take in image args both absalute path and relative
  - error check path arg
  - take in swatch mode args (average colours?, % of colours?, number of colours to count?, default being all?)
  - error check colour args
  - using image crate to check pixel values?
      - or make my own?
  - Make a gui version of this app using iced.rs
  - Keep cli simple and clean so learning gui is easy
  - Then can keep both in tandum as I wanna add more to this long term and learn rust in depth.
